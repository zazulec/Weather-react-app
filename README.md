# Application in continuous creation !!!!!!!

 I am aware that the application does not work well on Firebase and Github. I will try to solve it as soon as possible.
 Soon I will add gifs to the readme file showing the operation of the application.
 At the moment, to fully understand the application, I suggest you clone it.

## Main info about app:
This weather app is probably the best weather app in this repository!
Simply app shows current weather and 3 hour forecast for 5 days in Rechartd
App was created in React.

### Homepage:

On homepage you can check current weather in city you choose.

### Weather with GeoLocation:

In this part user can check his GeoLocation. Based on this data the application displays the current weather in this location.

### Five days forecast:

Five days forecast at start looks familiar to Homepage. First of all user choose city and then he can display temperature of next five days, each days separately in rechart.
