# Application in continuous creation !!!!!!!

 I am aware that the application does not work well on Firebase and Github. I will try to solve it as soon as possible.
 Soon I will add gifs to the readme file showing the operation of the application.
 At the moment, to fully understand the application, I suggest you clone it.

## Main info about app:
This weather app is probably the best weather app in this repository!
Simply app shows current weather and 3 hour forecast for 5 days in Rechartd
App was created in React.

## You can visit my app here on Firebase (problem with http fetch - Firebase needs fetch on https) [Weather-React-app]
(https://pz-my-apps.web.app/)

## You can visit my app here on GithubPages (GitHub Pages have problem with properly display SPA - showing only home page)[Weather-React-app]

2. Open it in (integrated development environment - IDE) like VSCode
2. Write in terminal -> npm install (to install all necessary files)
3. Write in terminal -> npm start to run in locally on your brawser
